            Hi… I am Sangita Adak. I am a hard-working engineering graduate specialised in Information Technology (with a cgpa 9.85) from RCCIIT. Currently I’m staying in Kolkata but my hometown is Haldia. I have done my 10th and 12th from BSBV and HGSVV respectively.
            I have deep interest in C language and I am currently working on Data Analysis project/projects using SIR MODEL. I have done a course on ALGORITHM AND ANALYSIS from NPTEL platform. I had been working with Brainiy Inc. as a freelancer problem solver in the department of Mathematics which highlights me as a team player, problem solver and a creative person too. And in my free times I used to listen music.
            THAT’S ALL ABOUT ME. THANK YOU.
        </p>
